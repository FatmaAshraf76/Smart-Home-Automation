# Smart-Home-Automation
Smart Home Automation Using ATmega32, LCD, Temperature Sensor, LDR Sensor, Flame Sensor and Motor Control.
smart home system that automates the control of lighting and fan speed based on environmental conditions. 

The project uses :
1) an ATmega32 microcontroller, 
2) LM35 temperature sensor,
3) LDR (Light Dependent Resistor),
4) Flame sensor,
5) PWM-controlled motor.
An LCD provides real-time display, and an H-bridge circuit controls the fan motor. 
Additionally, LEDs indicate varying light intensity levels.

This project involves developing a smart home system that adjusts lighting, fan speed, and safety alerts based on environmental conditions:

1) Lighting Control: The LDR detects ambient light intensity and controls three LEDs to indicate different levels of light.
2) Fan Speed Control: The LM35 temperature sensor adjusts the fan speed proportionally to the room temperature.
3) Fire Detection: A flame sensor detects fire, triggers an alarm, and displays a critical alert on the LCD.
4) LCD Display: Shows real-time temperature readings, fan status, light intensity, and alerts
